# granslandet.github.io
Ladning page for Gränslandet AB

This is the source code for my personal website **[gränslandet.se](https://gränslandet.se)**,  
a minimal black-and-white landing page for my BIM consultancy.

The site is built as a single static HTML/CSS page with a paper-like aesthetic.  
It automatically adapts to the user’s dark or light mode preferences.

---

## 🧱 Structure

- `index.html` – main content
- `style.css` – styling (supports dark/light mode)
- `assets/` – icons, images, and other resources

Hosted on **GitHub Pages**:  
[`https://runebjork.github.io`](https://runebjork.github.io)

## 🧰 Development

No build tools required.  
You can preview the site locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.
